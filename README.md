# MP3-Player-Project

This is a very basic MP3 player written to run on a stm32nucleo board with the Music Maker and TFT touch screen shields.   

It was written as a final project for the Embedded Systems class I took in 2016-17.  A basic framework was provided by the instructor, and I was required to write a basic driver for the I2C bus and implement a stop/start functionality using the touch screen.   Additional functionality allowed reading files from an SD card, and indicating playback time on the screen.

I plan to add some more functionality to the project, while I'm learning how better to manage a project up here in GitHub.
